Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist
For training the models dataset of 31,962 tweets is available. 
The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
